# Sam's tiny apps

Inspired by similar tiny apps from [Jeremy Howard](https://github.com/jph00/apps) and [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/), I've created a few tiny HTML/JS-based apps that I find useful. I hope you find them useful too! These tiny apps are made primarily using Claude, ChatGPT, and Github Copilot.
